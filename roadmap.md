# Gosu Language Server Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

A comprehensive VS Code extension for the Gosu programming language using Test-Driven Development (TDD) with mandatory 85% code coverage enforcement. The project follows a sophisticated monorepo structure using npm workspaces with four modules: client, server, parser, and shared.

## Architecture

- **Monorepo Structure**: npm workspaces with TypeScript project references
- **TDD Approach**: Test-first development with mandatory 85% coverage threshold
- **LSP Protocol**: Full Language Server Protocol implementation
- **ANTLR4 Parser**: Custom Gosu grammar with antlr4ng runtime
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest with v8 coverage provider
- **Build System**: TSX for direct TypeScript execution

- Word boundary detection and cursor position mapping
- Full LSP integration with onDefinition handler
- Document caching with change invalidation
- Support for classes, functions, variables, parameters, imports
- Extensible architecture for cross-file navigation

#### **Step 7: Hover Information (Completed)**
- [x] **Comprehensive symbol information on hover implemented**
- Rich hover cards with symbol details and markdown formatting
- Type information and documentation display
- Function signatures with parameter details and modifiers
- Import source and usage context
- AST-based symbol analysis integration
- Support for classes, interfaces, enhancements, functions, variables, parameters
- LSP protocol compliance with proper range information
- Comprehensive test coverage (30+ test cases)
- Document caching with change invalidation

### ðŸš§ Current Development Pipeline

#### **Step 8: Gosu-Java Cross-language Navigation (Pending)**
- [ ] **Cross-language definition and reference support**
- Java interop symbol resolution
- Bidirectional navigation between Gosu and Java
- Classpath analysis and Java type detection
- Enhanced import handling for Java types

#### **Step 9: Find References across Files (Pending)**
- [ ] **Workspace-wide reference analysis**
- Symbol usage tracking across multiple files
- Reference highlighting and navigation
- Rename refactoring support
- Workspace symbol search

#### **Step 10: Performance Optimization and Packaging (Pending)**
- [ ] **Final optimization and distribution preparation**
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Bundle size optimization
- Extension packaging and publishing
- Documentation and user guides

## Development Workflow

### **TDD Process**
1. **Red**: Write failing tests for new functionality
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Optimize while maintaining test coverage
4. **Coverage**: Ensure 85% threshold maintenance
5. **Commit**: Document and preserve each step

### **Quality Gates**
- All tests must pass before commits
- Coverage threshold must be maintained
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- LSP protocol specification adherence
- Performance benchmarks for large files

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. **Begin Step 7**: Implement hover information provider
   - Design hover card structure and content
   - Integrate with existing symbol extraction
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Ensure LSP protocol compliance

2. **Maintain Coverage**: Keep above 85% threshold throughout development

3. **Documentation**: Update inline documentation and examples

## Long-term Vision

- **Complete LSP Feature Set**: Full language server capabilities
- **Java Interoperability**: Seamless cross-language support
- **Performance Excellence**: Sub-100ms response times
- **Extension Ecosystem**: Foundation for additional Gosu tooling
- **Community Adoption**: Production-ready developer experience
